In this folder, I present the circuits I developed for the project. 

The first circuit, called SignalConditioning is in charge of taking as an input the signal of a type-k temperature sensor and then, conditioning the output to be compatible with the PLC analog reader module.

The second circuit called FeedbackControl, is in charge of receiving the control signal from the PLC and then uses a power stage with feedback to control the external DC supply in charge of heating the pieces.
